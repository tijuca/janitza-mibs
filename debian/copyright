Disclaimer: Standard Terms and Conditions of Contract of Janitza Electronics
 GmbH for the Provision of Software Free of Charge
 .
 § 1 Applicability of the Terms and Conditions of Contract
 (1) Unless otherwise agreed, exclusively these Standard Terms and Conditions of Contract apply for
     the provision of software free of charge to the user by Janitza Electronics GmbH, business domicile
     Vor dem Polstück 1, 35663 Lahnau (hereinafter called "JANITZA"). Deviating terms and conditions of
     contract of the user shall not form an integral part of the contract, even if JANITZA does not expressly
     contradict the same.
 (2) Even if no reference is made to them once more upon the conclusion of similar contracts,exclusively
     the Standard Terms and Conditions of Contract of Janitza Electronics GmbH for the
     Provision of Software Free of Charge shall apply in the version applicable when the user made his
     declaration (retrievable under www.janitza.de) unless the parties expressly agree otherwise in writing.
 (3) Supplemental hereto, the statutory provisions apply; for this provision of software free of charge, in
     particular §516 et seq. German Civil Code [Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch] BGB (gift)
 .
 § 2 Conclusion of the contract
 (1) The contract is concluded in such manner that JANITZA, at the request of the user for the provision
     of the software free of charge, sends him an e-mail in confirmation and subsequently does actually
     provide the user with the free software (including the pertinent data carrier, in so far as available).
 (2) Both parties are in agreement that the provision / gratuitous transfer of the software (and of the
     pertinent data carrier, in so far as relevant) is made free of charge.
 (3) A binding contract is not formed until the software is actually provided (in accordance with § 518 (1)
     German Civil Code (BGB), a promise of a gift needs to be recorded before a notary; this deficiency in
     form is only cured through the actual transfer, § 518 (2) BGB).
 (4) For other types of deliveries and services (e.g. delivery of hardware, software support, set-up and
     installation of software, training sessions) separate contracts are to be concluded.
 .
 § 3 Object of the contract; Scope of performance
 (1) The object of these Terms and Conditions of Contract is the provision of software free of charge
     (including the pertinent data carrier, in so far as available) to the user and the grant of the rights of use
     in accordance with § 4.
 (2) The free software (including the pertinent data carrier, in so far as available) is transferred in the
     status in which it is available to JANITZA at the point in time of the transfer ("as is").
 (3) Prior to the conclusion of the contract, the user shall verify that the specifications of the software
     conform with his wishes and requirements. He is familiar with the essential functional features and
     conditions of the software corresponding to the product description of JANITZA.
 (4) According to the current state of technology, it is not possible to prepare software programmes
     which work without faults in all cases of application. Product descriptions, illustrations, test
     programmes etc. are therefore general performance specifications, but do not constitute any
     guarantees. A guarantee requires a written declaration by the management of JANITZA.
 (5) The user will receive the software consisting of the machine programme and, in so far as available
     for the relevant software, a user manual in the form of a file. The method of the delivery of the software
     shall be determined by the agreements; in the absence of any other agreement, the programme and
     user manual will be delivered on a USB stick by post. The user has no claim to be provided with the
     source programme.
 .
 § 4 Rights of the user to the software
 (1) The software provided free of charge (programme and user manual) is legally protected. The
     copyright, patent rights, trademark rights and all other ancillary copyrights in the software, as well as
     all other items which JANITZA provides or makes available to the user within the framework of the
     contractual negotiations and performance of the contract shall, in the relationship of the parties
     interse, remain the sole property of JANITZA. Where such rights are held by third parties, JANITZA has the
      corresponding rights of use and exploitation.
 (2) The user shall only be entitled to process his own data himself and in his own operations and for
     his own purposes using the programme. All data processing equipment (e.g. hard disks and central
     processing units) on which the programmes are copied or transferred, either in whole or in part, either
     temporarily or permanently, must be located in the premises of the user and be in his direct
     possession. Further contractual provisions governing use (e.g. the limitation to a number of
     workplaces or persons) are to be implemented in technical terms and complied with in practice.
     JANITZA hereby grants the user the powers necessary for this use as a simple right of use, including
     the right to rectify faults. § 10 applies in respect of the period of the right of use.
 (3) The user may prepare such backup copies of the programmes, as are necessary for his safe
     operations. The backup copies must be safely stored and, in so far as technically feasible, labelled
     with the copyright notice of the original data carrier. Copyright notices may not be deleted, altered or
     suppressed. Copies which are no longer required must be deleted or destroyed. The user manual and
     other documents provided by JANITZA may only be copied for internal business purposes.
 (4) The user shall only be entitled to pass on the software or parts thereof free of charge to third
     parties in accordance with the following provisions and after carrying out the following procedures:
   a) Only one original data carrier may be passed on. Other software or software in another
      version may not be passed on.
   b) The user must delete all other copies of the software (irrespective of the version), in
      particular on data carriers and on solid state memories or random access memories (RAM).
      He shall relinquish the use of the same. He undertakes to carry out these procedures prior to
      passing on the original data carrier to third parties and to confirm this to JANITZA in writing
      without delay.
   c) The transfer to third parties is permanent, that is to say without any claim for return or any
      option of repurchase.
   d) The third party must give a written declaration to JANITZA that it will comply with § 4, § 10
      (2) and (3), § 11 and § 12 of these Standard Terms and Conditions of Contract directly vis-à-
      vis JANITZA.
   e) The written consent of JANITZA has been received. JANITZA shall be obliged to grant
      consent unless compelling reasons preclude the same (e.g. protection from competition).
     In the event of any breach of these provisions by the user, JANITZA reserves the right to claim
     damages.
 .
 (5) The provisions under paras. (2), (3) and (4 d), (e) also apply where the user eliminates the fault or
     (in so far as admissible) carries out any other modification of the programmes or uses the software for
     training purposes.
 (6) The user may only decompile the interface information of the programmes within the limits defined
     by § 69 e German Copyright Act [Urheberrechtsgesetz] (UrhG), and then only after informing JANITZA
     in writing of his intent together with a request for the necessary information to be provided within a
     period of at least two weeks. § 11 shall apply to all knowledge and information which the user may
     obtain in relation to the software during the decompiling process. Each time before involving third
     parties, the user shall provide JANITZA with a written declaration from the third party that the latter
     undertakes directly vis-à-vis JANITZA to comply with the provisions laid down in §§ 4 and 11.
 (7) No other forms of exploitation, in particular the sale, leasing, rental or distribution in tangible or
     intangible form, the use of the software by and for third parties (e.g. outsourcing, computer centre
     operations, application service providing) are permitted without the prior written consent of JANITZA.
 (8) Objects of the contract, documents, suggestions, test programmes etc. from JANITZA which
     become available to the user either before or following the conclusion of the contract are deemed to
     be intellectual property and business and company secrets of JANITZA. They may not be used in any
     manner without the written permission of JANITZA and must be kept confidential in accordance with §11.
 .
 § 5 Place of performance
  The place of performance for all performances under and in connection with this contract shall be the
  location of the head office of JANITZA.
 .
 § 6 Duties of the user
 (1) The user shall be obliged to test the programme thoroughly as to its usability in the specific
     situation before commencing any productive use.
 (2) The user shall be obliged to take reasonable precautions (e.g. through data back-ups, fault
     diagnosis, regular examination of the results, emergency planning) in order to deal with a situation in
     which the programme, either in whole or in part, does not work properly. It is the responsibility of the
     user to ensure the functionality of the working environment of the programme.
 .
 § 7 Material defects
 (1) The liability of JANITZA as towards the user for material defects in the software provided (including
     the pertinent data carrier, in so far as available) shall be restricted to the case of JANITZA fraudulently
     concealing from the user any material defect in the software. In such case, JANITZA shall reimburse
     the user the damage arising therefrom in accordance with § 524 (1) German Civil Code (BGB).
 (2) The user shall have no claim to have defects rectified by JANITZA in the case of software provided
     free of charge
 .
 § 8 Flaws in legal title
 (1) The liability of JANITZA as towards the user for flaws in the rights to the software provided
     (including the pertinent data carrier, in so far as available) shall be restricted to the case of JANITZA
     fraudulently concealing from the user any flaw in the rights to the software. In such case, JANITZA
     shall reimburse the user the damage arising therefrom in accordance with § 523 (1) German Civil
     Code (BGB).
 (2) The user shall inform JANITZA in writing without delay if any third party asserts industrial property
     rights (e.g. copyright or patent rights) against him in respect of the software. The user authorises
     JANITZA to conduct the dispute with the third party alone. So long as JANITZA avails itself of this
     authorisation, the user may not of his own initiative acknowledge the claims of the third party without
     the consent of JANITZA; JANITZA shall then at its own expense avert the claims of the third party and
     shall indemnify the user from all costs associated with averting such claims except in so far as these
     result from conduct on the part of the user in breach of duty (e.g. use of the programmes in breach of
     the terms of the contract).
 .
 § 9 Liability
 (1) With the exception of liability for material defects and flaws in legal title (see above §§ 7, 8),
     JANITZA shall only be liable in accordance with § 521 BGB in so far as the user asserts claims for
     damages based on deliberate intent or gross negligence, including the deliberate intent or gross
     negligence of representatives or vicarious agents of JANITZA.
 (2) JANITZA shall be free in each case to raise the defence of contributory negligence. The user is, in
     particular, under an obligation to prepare data back-ups and to protect his system from malicious
     software in accordance with the latest state of technology.
 .
 § 13 Commencement and end of the rights of the user
 (1) Ownership of the items provided and the rights pursuant to § 4 hereof shall pass to the user upon
     the transfer of the same.
 (2) JANITZA may revoke the rights under § 4 for compelling reasons. A compelling reason exists in
     particular if JANITZA cannot be reasonably expected to continue to maintain the contract in force, in
     particular where the user commits a significant breach of § 4.
 (3) Should the rights under § 4 not come into existence or should they end, JANITZA may demand of
     the user that he return the software provided or submit a written declaration that it has been destroyed,
     as well as the deletion or destruction of all copies of the software and a written assurance that this has
     taken place.
 .
 § 11 Confidentiality
 (1) Each party to the contract undertakes, also beyond the end of the contract, to treat as confidential
     all items provided to it by the respective other party or which have otherwise become known to it
     before or during the performance of the contract (e.g. software, documents, information) and which are
     legally protected or contain business or company secrets or are otherwise designated as being
     confidential, unless such items are already in the public domain without any breach of the duty of
     confidentiality. The parties shall store and secure these items in such a way as to ensure that no third
     party has access to them.
 (2) The user shall only make the objects of the contract accessible to those employees and other third
     parties who require access to the same for the performance of their contractual duties. The user shall
     instruct these persons regarding the necessity of maintaining confidentiality in relation to the items in
     question.
 (3) JANITZA shall process the necessary user data relevant for handling the business transaction in
     due compliance with the data protection provisions. JANITZA may name the user as a reference user
     following the successful conclusion of its services.
 .
 § 12 Final provisions
 (1) Any amendments and supplements to the contract need to be made in writing in order to be
     effective. The requirement of the written form may only be revoked in writing. Transmission in text
     form, in particular by fax or e-mail, shall suffice to satisfy the requirement of the written form.
 (2) These Terms and Conditions of Contract shall be governed by the law of the Federal Republic of
     Germany to the exclusion of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
 (3) The user may only set off claims of his own against claims of JANITZA if such claims are
     undisputed or have been judicially decided and are final and legally binding. Except as provided in §
     354 a German Commercial Code [Handelsgesetzbuch] (HGB), the user may only assign claims under
     this contract to third parties with the previous written consent of JANITZA. The user shall only be
     entitled to exercise a right of withholding or to raise the defence of non-performance of the contract
     within the scope of this contractual relationship.
 (4) In the case of contracts with business persons, public legal entities or bodies of public assets the
     place of performance and court venue for all disputes arising under and in connection with this
     contract shall be the location of the head office of JANITZA.

     Contract and any translations, the German version of these Terms and Conditions of Cantract is
